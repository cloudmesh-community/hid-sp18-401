\section{Apache Sling} 
Apache Sling is an open source web framework based on JCR
API, which is specifically made to deal with web content. The java platform is
developed to create applications on top of a JSR 170 compliant content
repository such as Apache Jackrabbit. In other words, sling is a REST API for
JCR, you can use http requests to manage content requests inside the repository.

Sling is different from many other Web application frameworks in the sense that
it truly focuses on the web aspect of the "web application" development and
through its development paradigm suggests an intuitive RESTful development of a
true web application. \cite{hid-sp18-401_wiki_Sling}.
