\section{Apache Impala}

Apache Impala acts as analytic database for Apache Hadoop. Impala can be used
from many open source distributions like Cloudera, MapR, Oracle and Amazon.
Impala has Enterprise-Class security i.e it is integrated with native hadoop
security and Kerberos for authentication~\cite{hid-sp18-401-wiki-Impala}.

Apache Impala is massively Parallel Processing SQL query engine that works on
data stored and run in Apache Hadoop clusters.'' It enables users to issue low-
latency SQL queries to data stored in HDFS and Apache HBase without requiring
data movement or transformation''~\cite{hid-sp18-401-apache-Impala}.
