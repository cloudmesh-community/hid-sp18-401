\section{Apache Ambari} 
Ambari is a software that to manage Hadoop environment
efficiently and simply  by providing monitoring and provisioning services. When
Apache Hadoop started developing with aim of increasing its scalability, several
application layers were covering its architecture like Pig, Hive, HBase .etc.
making the management of Hadoop architecture bulky and unmanageable. As Hadoop
started to increase its scalability, more and more application layers covered
its architecture making it bulky and unmanageable. Ambari is the solution to
these problems faced in handling huge Hadoop clusters.

The architecture of Apache Ambari includes two major components: Ambari Server
and Ambari Agent. Ambari Server is responsible for interacting with the agents
installed on the nodes, while Ambari Agents update the status of every node with
the help of various operational metrics \cite{hid-sp18-401_wiki_Ambari}.
