\section{Apache Celix} 
Apache Celix is an implementation of the OSGi
specification adapted to C and C++. It is a provides a framework to develop
(dynamic) modular software applications using component and/or service-oriented
programming.

Apache Celix is primarily developed in C and adds an additional abstraction, in
the form of a library, to support for C++.

Modularity in Apache Celix is achieved by supporting - run-time installed -
bundles. Bundles are zip files and can contain software modules in the form of
shared libraries. Modules can provide and request dynamic services, for and from
other modules, by interacting with a provided bundle context. Services in Apache
Celix are "plain old" structs with function pointers or "plain old C++ Objects"
(POCO) \cite{hid-sp18-401_Apache_Celix}.
