\section{Apache Tez} 
Apache Tez is a framework for building data processing
applications of directed-acyclic-graph of tasks. It is a framework that is based
and build on Apache Hadoop YARN \cite{hid-sp18-401_apache_Tez}.
 
Apache Tez improves speed of Mapreduce jobs while still supporting Mapreduceâ€™s
ability to scale to petabytes of data. Many Hadoop technologies like Hive, Pig
use Apache Tez for its improved speed on processing data in the clusters of
Apache Hadoop.Apache Tez provides a developer API and framework to write native
YARN applications \cite{hid-sp18-401_horton_Tez}
